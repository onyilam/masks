#description: Minimal tutorial on making a simple website with GitHub Pages
---

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

- [Overview](pages/overview.html)
- [Making an independent website](pages/independent_site.html)
- [Making a personal site](pages/user_site.html)
- [Making a site for a project](pages/project_site.html)
- [Making a jekyll-free site](pages/nojekyll.html)
- [Testing your site locally](pages/local_test.html)
- [Resources](pages/resources.html)
